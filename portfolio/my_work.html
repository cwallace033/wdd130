                    <p> A program in Python that I completed was a text-based adventure game. In it you, a villager in medieval times, had to make a series of choices that would either end up saving the village from a goblin ambush or perishing at the hands of vicious goblins. </p>

                    <p>My most recent project was for a word game. It was in a format similar to the popular word game “Wordle” where a user would guess what a word is and receive hints in the form of if letters from their guess was in the word and if they were where in that word.</p>

                    <p>  I have created a beautiful website for an admittedly fictitious river rafting website. This website was hand coded and designed by me including a home page and a page with the rates and dates of their trips. </p>
