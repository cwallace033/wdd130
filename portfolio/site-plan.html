        Intro:
        Nice to meet you! I’m Chase, your best option for quality web design and coding. I’m sure as you become familiar with my work and personality you will find exactly what you are looking for. 
        Take your time and feel free to reach out to me on the Contact Me page with any questions. Honesty is one of the most important things to me. 
        I believe all dealings should be honest and fair and always do what I need to in order to leave that impression with those I work with. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Education:
        I am currently going to BYUI to get a bachelor's degree in software development. I will graduate in 2026. School has been a great asset in helping me fine tune my abilities. 
        This has made me more able to quickly write clean and effective code. The world of tech was always something that fascinated me when I was young. To be able to work in it is a dream come true. I enjoy being able to solve problems and finding new ways for things to work. 
      </p>
      <p>
        History:
        The path for me to get where I am now wasn’t easy and it was anything but direct. I was able to acquire numerous life skills on the way. Working with people has always been a skill I had. Because of this I became a car salesman. 
        I enjoyed the social aspect of it however, the reputation associated with car salesmen isn’t one that I enjoyed. Although I was always honest and fair I was fighting against years of stereotypes. As a hobby I enjoyed making games for myself in Unreal Engine. 
        The challenge of writing code that had an effect I could see on screen was entertaining to me. After some time I took the leap of faith in making what I enjoy a career. I haven’t looked back since. 
      </p>
        <p>
        Family:
        Everything I do is for my family. I have a lovely wife and child. They support me and are a great inspiration.  A main part of me following this career path was to have a way to spend more time with them.

      <h3>My Work</h3>
      <p>
        Past Projects:
        I have worked on many things and particularly enjoy projects in Python. My most recent project was for a word game. It was in a format similar to the popular word game “Wordle” where a user would guess what a word is and receive hints in the form of if letters from their guess was in the word and if they were where in that word. 
        Another project in Python that I completed was a text-based adventure game. In it you, a villager in medieval times, had to make a series of choices that would either end up saving the village from a goblin ambush or perishing at the hands of vicious goblins.  
        On the web development side of things I have created a beautiful website for an admittedly fictitious river rafting website. This website was hand coded and designed by me including a home page and a page with the rates and dates of their trips. 
        Another website that I am very proud of is the one you are currently using. This also was coded and designed completely by me. As you can see I do consistent and quality work on all of my projects.
