                    <p> Nice to meet you! I’m Chase, your best option for quality web design and coding. I’m sure as you become familiar with my work and personality you will find exactly what you are looking for. 
                        Take your time and feel free to reach out to me on the Contact Me page with any questions. Honesty is one of the most important things to me. 
                        I believe all dealings should be honest and fair and always do what I need to in order to leave that impression with those I work with. Everything I do is for my family. I have a lovely wife and child. They support me and are a great inspiration.  
                        A main part of me following this career path was to have a way to spend more time with them.

                    <p> I am currently going to BYUI to get a bachelor's degree in software development. I will graduate in 2026. School has been a great asset in helping me fine tune my abilities. 
                        This has made me more able to quickly write clean and effective code. The world of tech was always something that fascinated me when I was young. To be able to work in it is a dream come true. I enjoy being able to solve problems and finding new ways for things to work.

                    <p> The path for me to get where I am now wasn’t easy and it was anything but direct. I was able to acquire numerous life skills on the way. Working with people has always been a skill I had. Because of this I became a car salesman. 
                        I enjoyed the social aspect of it however, the reputation associated with car salesmen isn’t one that I enjoyed. Although I was always honest and fair I was fighting against years of stereotypes. As a hobby I enjoyed making games for myself in Unreal Engine. 
                        The challenge of writing code that had an effect I could see on screen was entertaining to me. After some time I took the leap of faith in making what I enjoy a career. I haven’t looked back since.
