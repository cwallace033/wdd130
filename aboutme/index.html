    <p>Hi everybody! I am currently a stay at home dad. I live in Smithfield, Utah with my wife and our one year old son. Our son, Emmett, loves to be outside so I spend a lot of time outside with him. When I have a litle time to myself I enjoy reading, especially anything by Brandon Sanderson, or messing around creating enviornments or 2d platformers in Unreal Engine 5. </p>
    <p>  With school starting I am very excited to learn how to further my skills on the computer. I will be going into software development. My wife recently created a calendar she hopes to sell and I want to learn how to make a website for her! </p>
